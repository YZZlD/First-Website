                <h2>Scarlett</h2>
                <p>
                    I first got Scarlett from a breeder. I have allergies so I opted for getting a cat breed that was more hypoallergenic.
                    Bengals (which is Scarlett's breed) tend to shed less hair and have less of the chemical which cause allergic reactions
                    within their saliva. I got Scarlett around May 2021 as a kitten. Scarlett is a very energetic cat who loves running around
                    and playing with toys, but equally enjoys finding a nice place to sleep, be it a lap, sunny spot or dark closet.
                </p>
                <h2>Pixie</h2>
                <p>
                    Pixie had very different origins within my life. At first I was looking for a cat companion for Scarlett to hang out with.
                    This lead me to exploring many different avenues which eventually lead to Pixie. Pixie is a rescue cat who faced some past
                    trauma within her life. After talking with vets it seems she has been physically abused in the past which caused to her to
                    be both very skittish and cautious around humans. It took a while but she has become significantly less scared of me and others
                    while also having Scarlett become used to her presence. Now she is a very lovable cat who absolutely LOVES to play and will
                    even let others pet her (very gently and slowly). She loves one toy so much that she will instantly start playing with it
                    the moment you pick it up and wave it around no matter her mood or energy level. Pixie seems to be a bengal/x mix although
                    its unsure what she is a mix of.
                </p>
                <h2>Their Relationship</h2>
                <p>
                    At first Scarlett was somewhat hostile to Pixie's presence, so they had to be seperated. To acclimatize them to one another
                    they were given time to see each other through a glass-paned door. Over-time hostile actions like hissing, or agressive postures
                    slowly went away until eventually they were able to eat, sleep and play in the same areas. Fast forward to today and they love
                    to hang out with each other and occasionally sleep together. However as they are both very hungry cats they will attempt to
                    steal each other's food thus feeding them requires some supervision to make sure neither of them go hungry. The picture at
                    the bottom is them sleeping together. Right is Scarlett left is Pixie.
