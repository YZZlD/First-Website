# First-Website
Simple Website made using basic HTML/CSS skills.
This project is a personal project to display HTML/CSS skills and is in no way commerical.

The theme of this project is a cat based website involving some content related to my cats as well
as some general cat content. This includes rescue/adoption website links, a user survey, general cat
information and some pictures and information about different cat breeds.

Big shout outs to coolors.co for helping me create a colour palette. The tool is super simple and really
helpful for creating a pleasing colour palette for whatever your needs are.
